# hello-world
starting GitHub
I like to code, I have some experience of HTML, CSS, Javascript,PHP and SQL. Using a GUI to design a Web Page/Site would not work for me .
I need to know what is happing under the hood.
Also I use Linux, Debian, Windows For Workgroups, Linux for Everyone and Everything Else!!!
By trade I am an Electrician, but really I should of went to College and studied "Computer Science" but that was so many years ago.
