# hello-world
Starting GitHub:
I like to code, I have some experience of HTML, CSS, Javascript,PHP and SQL. Using a GUI to design a Web Page/Site does not work for me. I need to know what is happing under the hood.

I use Linux, Debian to be exact, Windows For Workgroups...Linux for Everyone and Everything Else!!!

By trade I am an Electrician, if I had it all over again I would go to College and studied "Microprocessing" but that was soooo many years ago.
